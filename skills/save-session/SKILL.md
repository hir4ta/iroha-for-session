name: save-session
description: Save the current Claude Code session to Notion as structured, visual, queryable memory — decisions (with rationale and rejected alternatives), dev rules, work-state (done / unfinished), changed files, key commands, and chat-style highlights of the key exchanges. Use at the end of a working session, or when the user says "save this session" / "セッションを保存" / "まとめて保存". Requires a connected Notion MCP and a prior /iroha:init.

# iroha: save-session

Persist this session to Notion so humans and future Claude sessions can recall what
was decided, what is unfinished, and why. You produce the intelligence (summary,
decisions, rules, classification, chat highlights); `scripts/extract.sh` produces the
deterministic parts (files, commands, metadata). All Notion writes go through the
connected Notion MCP. Write Notion content in the **user's conversation language**.

## 1. Preconditions

Confirm Notion MCP is connected, then load the cached ids:

```bash
L="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_lib/config.sh"
bash "$L" get session_ds_id    # empty -> tell the user to run /iroha:init, then stop
bash "$L" get decisions_ds_id
bash "$L" get container_page_id
[ -e "$(bash "$L" saved-dir)/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" ] && echo "ALREADY_SAVED"
```

**Re-save guard (idempotency).** If the last line prints `ALREADY_SAVED`, this session
was already saved. Do **not** create duplicate Session / Decision rows — tell the user
it is already saved and offer to *update* the existing rows instead; stop unless they
confirm. (Duplicate decisions are the one defect that rots the "living memory".)

## 2. Locate this session's transcript

```bash
TX=$(ls -t "$HOME/.claude/projects/"*"/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}.jsonl" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
echo "$TX"
```

## 3. Deterministic extraction

```bash
E="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extract.sh"
bash "$E" meta     "$TX"   # JSON: title, started, ended, cwd, gitBranch, model
bash "$E" files    "$TX"
bash "$E" commands "$TX"
bash "$E" prompts  "$TX"   # the human's real messages — the You-side anchor (step 7)
bash "$E" stats    "$TX"   # JSON metrics: turns, toolCalls, filesEdited, bash, durationMin
bash "$E" tools    "$TX"   # per-tool tally for the Details / Tools toggle
bash "$E" chat     "$TX"   # cleaned full chat (per-turn capped) for the Full-chat toggle
git config user.name 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"   # Author
```

(The full transcript is large and is **not** stored. The chat highlights (step 7) come
from your memory of the session, but the **You** side is anchored to the deterministic
`prompts` output above — never invented.)

## 4. Compose the content (from your memory of the session + the extracted data)

- **Summary** — 1-3 sentences (the `Summary` property + search snippet).
- **Decisions** — each: the decision, *why*, and *rejected alternatives*. A decision
  to NOT do something counts.
- **Rules changed** — only rules/conventions **newly established or changed this
  session** (CLAUDE.md / memory promotion candidates). Do **not** re-list unchanged
  project rules — those live in CLAUDE.md / the Decisions DB, not in every session.
- **Done** / **Unfinished / Next** — work-state, for the Project State carry-over.
- **Failures** — error -> root cause -> fix.
- **Highlights** — 5-8 pivotal You<->Claude exchanges, paraphrased, to render
  chat-style (NOT the full transcript).
- **Type** — any of 調査 / 要件定義 / 設計 / 実装 / 修正 / リファクタ / レビュー
  (infer from the transcript).
- **Status** — `$ARGUMENTS` if given, else infer Complete / WIP / Interrupted.

## 5. Create the Session row

`notion-create-pages` with `parent: {"type":"data_source_id","data_source_id":"<session_ds_id>"}`.
Property map uses SQLite values:
- `Name` (title) — **`YYYY-MM-DD — <topic>`** (start date + a ≤20-char noun-phrase
  topic; no project prefix, no Type — those are properties). Calendar / Board cards show
  only the Name, so the date prefix keeps them time-scannable. Good:
  `2026-06-24 — Notion 連携の設計と Phase 1 実装`. Bad: `iroha: 設計・実装` (no date) /
  `[設計/実装] …` (Type duplicated).
- `Project`, `Status`, `Branch`, `Author`, `Summary` — plain strings.
- `Type` — a JSON array **string**, e.g. `"[\"設計\", \"実装\"]"`.
- Date — expanded keys: `"date:Date:start"` = started ISO, `"date:Date:is_datetime"` = `1`
  **as a JSON number, not the string `"1"`** (a string is rejected with a 400).

**`content` = Notion-flavored Markdown, visual and monochrome (no emoji icons).**
Render **all headings and labels in the user's conversation language, defaulting to
English** when unsure. Read the spec once via `notion://docs/enhanced-markdown-spec`.
Emit **exactly these sections, in this order, on every save** — the structure must be
identical each time. The **only** optional sections are **Architecture**, **Rules
changed**, and **Failures** (include them only when they apply); never add, drop,
rename, or reorder anything else (English canonical names shown — translate them to the
user's language). Do **not** add an Overview / meta table — the page properties already
show Project / Status / Type / Date / Branch / Author at the top:
1. a header `<callout color="blue_bg">` with the one-line summary;
2. `## Metrics` — a `<callout color="gray_bg">` dashboard built **verbatim from
   `extract.sh stats`** (never hand-count). One line, ` · `-separated, e.g.
   `⏱ 79 min · 🗣 4↔38 turns · 🔧 72 tool calls · ✎ 5 files · ⌘ 12 bash` — but **no emoji**
   (house rule): use text labels instead — `Duration 79 min · Turns 4↔38 · Tool calls 72
   · Files 5 · Bash 12`. Always included; it makes each session scannable at a glance;
3. `## Architecture` *(optional — only when the work has structure)* with a ```mermaid``` diagram;
4. `## Decisions` as a `<table header-row="true">` with a `<tr color="blue_bg">` header
   (columns: Decision / Why / Rejected alternatives);
5. `## Progress` as a green_bg callout (Done) + an orange_bg callout (Unfinished, `- [ ]`);
6. `## Highlights` — 5-8 pivotal exchanges as alternating chat-style callouts
   (You = `blue_bg`, Claude = `gray_bg`); the **You** lines come from the `prompts`
   extract (real messages, never invented), Claude lines are paraphrased — **not** the
   full chat (see step 7);
7. `## Rules changed` *(optional — only when this session established or changed a rule)*
   as a `<callout color="gray_bg">`; omit the whole section when no rule changed;
8. `## Failures` *(optional — only when there were notable pitfalls)* as a
   `<details><summary>…</summary>` toggle (pitfall -> fix);
9. `## Details` with `<details><summary>…</summary>` toggles, in this order:
   **Changed files** (`extract.sh files`), **Commands** (`extract.sh commands`),
   **Tools** (`extract.sh tools` — the per-tool tally), and **Full chat** (`extract.sh
   chat` — the cleaned, per-turn-capped transcript that backs the curated Highlights;
   this is the audit trail, collapsed by default). Render the `files` / `commands` /
   `tools` outputs as **bulleted lists** verbatim (they are already `- ` lists; never
   join entries with `·`). For **Full chat**, render each line as its own paragraph;
   if `chat` is empty (rare), write "（本文なし）" rather than dropping the toggle.
Wrap every file name / command / path in backticks — **including inside callouts and
tables** — so Notion does not auto-linkify `.sh` / `.md` names as `http://…` URLs.
Indent callout / toggle / table children with **tabs**. Keep the returned page URL.

Set a clean monochrome page icon:
`icon: "https://www.notion.so/icons/notebook_gray.svg"`.

## 6. Create the Decision rows

**What earns a Decision row.** Only **architecture / dependency / process** choices that
shape the project belong in the Decisions DB. Keep display / naming / wording tweaks in
the Session's Decisions table — do **not** promote them, so recall's signal-to-noise stays
high. A decision to NOT do something still counts.

For each decision, `notion-create-pages` under `decisions_ds_id`. `Name` = a short
**`<topic>: <choice>`** title (≤24 chars, no parenthetical) — e.g. `Notion 連携: MCP 一本`,
`連結: relation でなく URL`. Keep the *why* in `Rationale` and the rejected options in
`Alternatives`, never in the Name. Also set `Project`, `Status` = `Active`, `Tags` (JSON
array string from architecture / dependency / process), `Session` = the Session page URL
from step 5, `"date:Date:start"`.

**Dedup & supersede.** A decision's `Name` is `<topic>: <choice>`, so the **topic
prefix is the dedup key.** Before inserting, `notion-search` the Decisions DB for the
topic and check whether an `Active` row whose `Name` starts with the same `<topic>:`
already exists. If it does and is unchanged, do **not** insert a duplicate. If this
session **reverses or changes** it, set that old row's `Status` = `Superseded` with
`notion-update-page` (do **not** overwrite it — the change of mind is itself memory
worth recalling) and create the new decision alongside it.

Decisions live **only in Notion** (the single source of truth). Do not write a local
decision mirror — recall reads decisions live via `notion-search`, so there is no local
copy to drift out of sync.

## 7. Chat highlights — curated, anchored to real messages

The full chat is **not** stored (too large to append through the MCP in one session).
Build the `## Highlights` section instead, but **anchor it to the deterministic
`prompts` output from step 3 — those are the human's actual words.**

- **You callouts** — use the real messages from `prompts`, condensed but **never
  invented**. Do not write a "You" line the human did not actually say, and do not turn
  your own analysis into a question they "asked". Pick the 5-8 that drove the key
  decisions.
- **Claude callouts** — paraphrase your replies concisely, and report what *actually*
  happened: **do not inflate success.** Keep the dead-ends, the corrections, and the
  things you decided NOT to do at the same weight as the wins — a highlight reel that
  shows only the clean path is a misleading memory.
- Render as alternating chat-style callouts (You = `blue_bg`, Claude = `gray_bg`); do
  **not** dump the whole transcript or flatten it into prose.

## 8. Update the Project State page (continuity core)

```bash
PROJ="$PWD"
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_lib/config.sh" get-state "$PROJ"
```

State is the SessionStart hook's stable, human-readable anchor — keep it **slim** and
**do not** re-transcribe decisions or rules (those live in the Decisions DB / CLAUDE.md;
re-listing them here only duplicates the latest Session row). State body (monochrome):
latest summary + date, a **Recent sessions** list (newest first, links to the last few
Session pages), the carried-over **Unfinished / Next** list, and a link to the Decisions
DB.

**Triage the carry-over** every time (this keeps `Unfinished` from rotting into a
graveyard): for each item carried from the prior State, decide done / still-active /
stale-drop — keep only what is genuinely still pending, and mark anything carried for
**2+ sessions** so the team notices stale work. State is fully replaced each save, so
this triage cannot drift.
- If get-state is empty: `notion-create-pages` under `container_page_id`
  (title `State — <project>`, icon `https://www.notion.so/icons/target_gray.svg`),
  then `bash …/config.sh set-state "$PROJ" "<page_id>"`.
- Else: `notion-update-page` `replace_content` on that page id.
- **Also mirror the State body into the repo** so a teammate's SessionStart hook can
  inject it offline (it lives at `<repo>/.iroha/state.md`, overwritten each save so it
  never drifts):
  `MD="$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_lib/config.sh" state-md-path "$PWD")"; mkdir -p "$(dirname "$MD")"; printf '%s' "<state body>" > "$MD"`.
  **Remind the user to commit `.iroha/state.md`** so the memory reaches teammates. Notion
  is the single source of truth for decisions/sessions (recall reads it via
  `notion-search`); the repo only holds this State mirror for the offline hook.

## 9. Mark saved + report

```bash
SAVED="$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_lib/config.sh" saved-dir)"
mkdir -p "$SAVED" && : > "$SAVED/${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}"
```

Report the Session page URL, how many decisions were recorded, and that the Project
State was updated.

## Notes

- Do not write secrets to Notion; if the transcript surfaced any, omit them.
- Highlights come from your memory of the session, not a transcript dump; the full
  chat is intentionally not stored (too large to append per session).
- If the stack changed materially this session (new lockfile / framework / CI), suggest
  the user run `/iroha:project` to refresh the project's architecture profile.
